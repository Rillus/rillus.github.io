Often as I'm browsing the Internet I'll grab a note of some software I'd like to tinker with. Inclusion in this list doesn't indicate any endorsement, only that I found it interesting and potentially worthy of further investigation.

I'll try and highlight the ones I've used, and curate/maintain this list over time.

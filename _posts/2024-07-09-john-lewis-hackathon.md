A week ago, [Waitrose & Partners](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/waitroseandpartners?trk=public_post-text) had their first AI hackathon. Although I wasn't there, my teammate [Mark Winteringham](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/markwinteringham?trk=public_post-text) (something of an AI expert) took part and has written up his experiences in this article: [https://lnkd.in/e5Niqu_d](https://lnkd.in/e5Niqu_d?trk=public_post-text) Tomorrow and Thursday, I'll be working with Mark on another AI hackathon, this time specifically for [John Lewis & Partners](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/johnlewisandpartners?trk=public_post-text) to see what we can come up with on this side of the business. I'll let you know how it goes and what the result is (if it's not top secret!).

Article Outline: The Anathema of Enshittification

*The salesman knows nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it.* â€“ Oscar Wilde
## Introduction
You may have heard the term "enshittification" in reference to how the Internet seems to be getting worse: harder to navigate, use and achieve your goals. This process, exemplified by companies like Uber and (in the ticketing sphere) Eventbrite, involves a three-step cycle: subsidise, corner the market, and then raise prices (or insert advertising/make previously free features paid). While this model has proven profitable for these businesses, it has had negative consequences for consumers, competitors, and the wider internet ecosystem. I was raised more frugally than the excesses of Silicon Valley, and have built up my own business, Ticketlab, on a different approach, demonstrating that sustainable growth and long-term value are not only achievable but desirable.
 
## The Uber Model: A Case Study
The Uber Model, a strategy employed by many tech companies, involves a three-step process: subsidize, corner, and raise prices. Initially, companies like Uber offer their services at a loss, often funded by venture capital, to attract a large customer base. Once they dominate the market, they reduce or eliminate subsidies, raising prices (and reducing driver wages) to capitalize on their monopoly. This strategy has negative consequences for consumers, who face higher prices and reduced choices, as well as for competitors, who may be unable to compete with the subsidized prices. Additionally, the Uber model can contribute to a broader decline in innovation and competition within the Internet ecosystem. For example, Uber's aggressive tactics have led to concerns about labor exploitation, anti-competitive behavior, and regulatory challenges.

We've seen a similar tactic by Eventbrite, with successive fee increases (including charging for free events) but yet still making a loss despite its brand recognition in the sector.

## Ticketlab: A Different Approach
Ticketlab's business model diverges significantly from the Uber model. Instead of prioritizing rapid growth and aggressive market dominance, Ticketlab focuses on sustainable growth and long-term value. This approach involves setting reasonable prices from the outset, ensuring profitability without the need for drastic price increases later (we've not updated our prices since2017, when we actually lowered them). By investing in user-friendly features and tools, Ticketlab aims to empower event organizers to manage their events independently, reducing operational costs and ensuring a more sustainable business model. One main area we've increased our spend and attention is in user support: ensuring ticket buyers and event organisers can actually communicate with us (primarily via email). This focus on sustainability benefits both Ticketlab and its customers by fostering trust, long-term relationships, and a more stable platform.

What's the problem with this approach? It likely means never being a unicorn and cashing out to buy an island.
